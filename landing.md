			<h2>My vision</h2>
		</header>
		<p>My research interests are in applying Artificial Intelligence in Healthcare projects, especially the ones related to Medical Images. Over the years, during my learning journey, I became involved in projects in different areas, allowing me to gain a broad knowledge and work with incredible professionals.</p>

					<h3>Eye drops Identifier</h3>
				</header>
				<p>Low vision patients experience great challenges in trying to correctly identify the packaging and containers of eye drops in stressful situations. We developed, in partnership with the GeekVision group, an eyelash identifier through the use of a Convolutional Neural Network architecture that classifies the packaging and container label.</p>

					<h3>Deep Learning Car Damage Report</h3>
				</header>
				<p>Nowadays, in in the Insurance sector, sinister damage identification takes lots of time and effort to process. From the very beginning with a call/email, through the damage assessment, and finishing up with the sinister payment (where applicable). Therefore, a new application based on multiple AI algorithms to detect vehicle brand, damages, and number plates are used to ease up sinister pre-classification.</p>
